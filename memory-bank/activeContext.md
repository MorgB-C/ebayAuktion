# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on documenting the project's history and structure by creating the Memory Bank files based on the chat history.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial POC for the eBay Auction Generator.
- Added features for "Buy It Now" price calculation, photo uploads, and text snippets.
- Set up a Git repository and pushed the project to GitHub.
- Deployed the project to GitHub Pages.
- Generated all core Memory Bank files.

## Next Steps
- Commit the newly created `memory-bank` directory to the Git repository.
- Push the commit to the `main` branch on GitHub to make the documentation part of the official repository.
- The next logical feature would be to integrate the eBay API to create actual auctions.
