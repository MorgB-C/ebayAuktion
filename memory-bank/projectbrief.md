# Project Brief: eBay Auction Generator

## Core Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a tool that simplifies and automates the process of generating eBay auctions.

## Initial Scope (POC)
The project starts as a Proof of Concept (POC) with a single-screen web application. The user can input auction details, and the tool will generate the necessary information. The initial focus is on creating the user interface and the basic client-side logic, without a backend or direct eBay API integration.
